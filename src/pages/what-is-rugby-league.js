        <i>A Brief History</i>
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          In 1895 representatives of the 22 clubs based in the North of England
          decided to split from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and start a new
          organisation called the Northern Union, which would become the Rugby
          Football League (RFL). The reason for this split was the desire to pay
          players for turning out for the clubs. At the time players worked 6
          days a week and would have to take time off from work to play, which
          of course meant that they missed out on their work payment. This
          wasn't such an issue for clubs in the south of England where players
          were often wealthy gentlemen. However in poorer regions this was a
          problem. The Northern clubs had proposed to reimburse people for lost
          earnings but this had been refused by the RFU. They had seen how
          Football had recently become professional, and were concerned at the
          increasing numbers of working class people playing that game, a
          situation that they didn't want repeated with rugby!

          Over the following years the RFL took steps to make the game more open
          and exciting for fans, in order to afford paying their players. They
          reduced the number of players to 13, removed the line out, reduced the
          number of points for a penalty kicks to encourage more tries and
          eventually introduced the play the ball after a tackle, giving us the
          game we know and recognise today as a distinct sport from rugby union.
