Sweden Rugby League are delighted to announce that after a break in 2023 they will be back in action before the end of the year. This will provide Sweden with an opportunity to return to play and sees them looking to build on their previous outing, where they defeated Poland 50 - 16 in 2019.

While Sweden have found themselves inhibited by the pandemic, the Netherlands managed to play the only International Rugby League fixture in 2020, beating their neighbours Germany. This match almost didn't take place due to several disruptions caused by changes in local Covid regulations, forcing a late change of location. They overcame Germany again in 2021 and also competed in the European D Championships in Turkey, emerging as the champions after wins against Malta and the Czech Republic. This strong run of form has seen them climb the international rankings to reach 14th in the world.

Previous meetings between the two countries have gone in the Netherlands' favour, holding off a late Swedish charge in 2017 to edge a close game in Amsterdam, followed by a more comfortable victory in 2018 in Göteborg.

SRL President, Sebastian Johnson-Cadwell, had the following to say after announcing the fixture, “We’re really excited to take on the Dutch boys again after the COVID break. They’re a great side and we’ll need to be at our best for this fixture. We play rugby for the challenge and are really looking forward to it. SRL are in talks with other nations for additional test matches this year - stay tuned for more.”
