Sweden Rugby League are delighted to announce that after a break in 2023 they will be back in action before the end of the year. This time we will be breaking new ground and taking the game to Iceland who have recently celebrated their first rugby league fixture against our neighbours Norway.

SRL President, Sebastian Johnson-Cadwell, had the following to say after announcing the fixture, “We’re really excited to take on the Icelandic boys after their recent debut fixture. The Norwegians Pioneer side that visited gave them a hard game so they'll be keen to take the lessons they've learned from that match and put them into practise against us. The SRL are in talks with other nations for test matches in the new year so stay tuned for more.”
