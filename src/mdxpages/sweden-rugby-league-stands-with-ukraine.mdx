Like many around the world, those of us making up SRL have watched horrified as Ukrainians have found themselves fighting for their existence.Â We wish to express our solidarity not just with our rugby league friends who are members of UFRL but with all Ukrainians during this terrible time. We hope that this will be resolved soon and members of UFRL can leave the battlefield and return to the rugby field.

If you wish to support Ukraine then the rugby league community is partnered with Unicef to support children caught in the conflict. If you live in Sweden the Akelius Foundation will double your donation throughout the month of March: 

- [Sverige](https://unicef.se/katastrof/hjalp-ukrainas-barn)
- [United Kingdom](https://www.unicef.org.uk/donate/donate-now-to-protect-children-in-ukraine/)
- [Australia](https://www.unicef.org.au/appeals/ukraine-emergency-appeal)

If you wish to support Ukraine Rugby League then 1908 will be releasing a special edition Ukrainian shirt based on their 2018 qualifying kit which you can preorder [here](https://1908.store/collections/international/products/pre-order-ukraine-national-jersey)
