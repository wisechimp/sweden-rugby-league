Sweden Rugby League and Skåne Stags will be hosting a domestic 9’s session in Malmö on the 22nd February. This will be an opportunity for experienced players to get back into the swing of things at the start of the season, and for new players to come along and see what they’ve been missing. The event will be indoors at [Kombihallen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kombihallen,+217+62+Malm%C3%B6/@55.5828638,12.9872108) next to Malmö FF’s ground starting at 13:00 and finishing at 17:00.

9’s is the short form of rugby league (like 7’s in Union) and is becoming increasingly popular with successful tournaments in London and a recent World Cup won bu Australia in 2019.

Check out more information about the event on the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/530126340936273/) page. See you there!
